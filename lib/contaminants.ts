While hardness primarily measures the levels of calcium and magnesium in your water, other ions like aluminum, copper, barium, iron, manganese, strontium, and zinc also contribute to total hardness. Hardness is usually reported in units of calcium carbonate equivalency, but grains per gallon is a common alternative unit. Water that has high hardness, described as 'hard water', contains high concentrations of naturally occurring dissolved minerals. The hardness of water indicates the degree to which the water reacts with soap; hard water requires more soap to produce a lather and often deposits precipitates, or 'soap scum'. There is no official hardness scale but we use the following ranges, which are endorsed by the WHO: soft = below 60 mg/L as CaCO3; moderately hard = 60–120 mg/L; hard = 120–180 mg/L; and very hard = more than 180 mg/L.",

High levels of phosphorus in water can lead to eutrophication, where oxygen levels become reduced due to high nutrient levels. Eutrophication causes uncontrollable plant and algae growth, which in turn has serious repercussions for water quality.

This process is called ionizing radiation, and may lead to harmful changes in cells and tissues. The toxicity of a beta emitter depends on the amount of energy it releases and how organ systems respond to that energy. Exposure to elevated gross beta activity is associated with increased cancer risk and genotoxicity, but toxicity to individual systems is dependent on the type of beta emitter present. Gross beta activity in drinking water is regulated in a slightly more complicated manner than is typical for other contaminants. Gross beta is measured by laboratories in units of pCi/L, the contribution of potassium-40 is subtracted, and if that total exceeds 50 pCi/L the individual ions contributing to the beta radiation are determined.

Elemental arsenic is primarily used in the production of arsenic alloys, which are often used in lead-acid batteries, as well as in semiconductors and light-emitting diodes.

      'Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) is a calculated value that indicates the likelihood that calcium carbonate–i.e. "scale"–will form on the walls of pipes and fixtures. LSI is determined by a water sample\'s alkalinity, calcium concentration, total dissolved solids, temperature and pH. It is a unit-less value that typically ranges between -2 and 2. It is ideal for water to have a slightly positive LSI, which indicates the potential for moderate scale formation in pipes, which protects them from corrosion. High, positive values of LSI indicate a potential for excessive scale, which can decrease the flow of water through pipes. While large negative values of LSI are thought to indicate potential for corrosion of pipes, a negative value simply indicates that scale formation is unlikely, which on its own is an inadequate indicator of corrosion.',

      "Ethylbenzene is a volatile organic compound that occurs naturally in coal tar and petroleum. It is a member of a class of compounds called BTEX, which are among the most abundantly produced chemicals in the world, notably created and used in petroleum processing and the production of consumer goods. Ethylbenzene is primarily used as a precursor for styrene, which is used in styrofoam. Additional products that include ethylbenzene are gasoline, carpet glues, varnishes, pesticides, tobacco products, and paints. Ethylbenzene is readily volatile, thus all routes of exposure (ingestion, inhalation and dermal) are relevant if one is exposed via drinking water. Health effects associated with elevated ethylbenzene exposures include liver and kidney toxicity.",

Fruity odors can be caused by the presence of microbial by-products, chemicals produced during the ozonation of water for disinfection, the presence of artificial odorants such as those used in perfumes, and other industrial waste sources. Medicinal odors can be due to the presence of various phenolic compounds created upon oxidation of drinking water for disinfection.

Fishy/rancid odors can result from the by-products of algal growth or disinfection of water supplies. Marshy odors can be due to the decaying of organic matter. Specifically, sulfurous odors, often described as "rotten eggs", are due to the presence of hydrogen sulfide gas which is created by sulfate-reducing bacteria, usually present in pipes or other plumbing elements.

      "pH is a measure of the acidic or basic nature of a water sample. More specifically, pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in water. The pH scale ranges from 0 (acidic) to 14 (basic or caustic). A pH of 7.0 is neutral, and tap water should have a pH between 6.5 and 8.5. The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that each step on the scale corresponds to a ten-fold change in acidity. Shifts in tap water pH can be caused by a variety of physical, chemical and microbiological factors, making pH a crucial indicator of chemical changes and health of drinking water. Importantly, sample pH can change during transport to the lab depending on many factors. As a result, pH test strips or on-site sensors provide the most accurate representation of pH. Differences between on-site and laboratory measurements are thought to happen due to: 1) microbial activity; 2) particulate matter breakdown that may lead to neutralization; 3) chemical changes that could occur during shipping.",

Specifically, CSMR is used to predict the likelihood of galvanic corrosion, which could result in the release of lead into the water. Galvanic corrosion is specific to cases where lead pipes are connected to pipes made of other materials (often copper). CSMR is calculated by dividing the concentration of chloride in water by the concentration of sulfate in water. As such, CSMR indicates the balance between the corrosive properties of chloride and the protective properties of sulfate. High values of CSMR, especially in combination with low alkalinity (or the ability of water to buffer changes in acidity), indicate a high likelihood that galvanic corrosion will occur if there are lead materials connected to other metals in the distribution system or household plumbing, potentially leading to lead release.",

Fusarium solani is a common plant pathogen that impacts a number of different agriculturally relevant crops, including soybeans, peas, potatoes, and various gourds. It is also an opportunistic pathogen in humans that primarily causes disease in immunocompromised individuals, but has also caused fungal keratitis (infection of the cornea) in immunocompetent individuals. Fusarium solani has also been detected in drinking water distribution infrastructure--certain fungi are known to collect and proliferate in biofilms in drinking water distribution systems.',

      "Melosira varians is a species of freshwater diatom widespread across North America. Its cells are spherical and often join together to form long chains, which are primarily found attached to the sediment at the bottom of water bodies. It may also float freely among plankton as single cells or chains. M. varians thrives in nutrient-rich waters, including polluted environments, and may form blooms that can complicate water treatment processes and potentially harm aquatic life.",
